Protein folding using quantum computers

Protein folding has been one of the most difficult problems for over a half-century,The
random thermal motions causing conformational changes that lead energetically
downhill towards the native structure, a principle captured in funnel-shaped energy
landscapes.
Unfolded polypeptides have a wide range of possible conformations. The
search problem becomes intractable for classical computers due to the exponential
growth of potential conformations with chain length. So far, there is theoretical and
experimental evidence that solving such optimization problems using Quantum
Computing approaches such as Quantum Annealing, VQE, and QAOA has an
advantage.
